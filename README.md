----

Simple mod that unlocks the second floor.

Removes the two rope barriers on the stairs and other invisible walls upstairs. You must unlock the level eight area to access staircases (or jump over the wall).

You can place all types of furniture upstairs, but know that customers cannot access any tables on the second floor.

The developers definitely intend to add content to the upstairs area in the future. Build up there at your own risk.

## Installation

- The only requirement for this mod is [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/ale-and-tale-tavern/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/).

### Mod Manager

Install this mod directly in r2modman or the Thunderstore Launcher by clicking the big blue "Install with Mod Manager" button above.

### Manual Installation

To manually install this mod, download and unzip the file. Place the folder in your {game}/BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Multiplayer
- This mod works in multiplayer. 

*This mod is client-side only, meaning that any client that does not have the mod will not be able to pass through the barriers. Please play this on servers where the host is fine with it.*

## Known Issues
- Customers not using tables on the second floor
    - This is a pathfinding issue. Customer navigation is simply not ready yet to access the second floor. I'm sure the developers will implement this whenever they get a chance.
