# Ale and Tavern Tale - Unlocked Second Floor

Simple mod that unlocks the second floor.

Removes the two rope barriers on the stairs and other invisible walls upstairs. You must unlock the level eight area to access staircases (or jump over the wall).

Works in Multiplayer. Any client that does not have the mod will not be able to go upstairs. Only use this in servers where the host allows it.

**This mod requires BepInEx.**

## NOTE:
The developers definitely intend to add content to the upstairs area. Build up there at your own risk.
